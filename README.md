# Ford GoBike System Analysis
George Helsby

## Dataset
The dataset consists of roughly 1.8 million bike rides from 2018. The variables include the trip start & end time, start & end station, trip duration in seconds as well as extra information such as user type.

## Summary of Findings


## Key Insights
For the presentation, I focus on customer habits in 2018. Since the Ford GoBike System currently offers 3 subscribtion types: Single Ride, Access Pass (24h or 72h) and Monthly Membership, I start by introducing the split between those who use the system occasionally and those who has a membership. Afterwards, I move to daily and weekly habits of customers. I use the heatmap to show when bikes are high in demand throughout the week. To finish, I introduce the histogram of the trip duration per customer type to further show the differences in renting behaviour.
